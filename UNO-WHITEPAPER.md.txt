UNO-S v1.3 “Epistemic Glitch”
Protocol-Driven Cognitive Engine for Wicked Problems

Author: Mirosław
Version: 1.3 (Patched)
Codename: Epistemic Glitch

Abstract

UNO-S (Unified Negotiation Operator – Synthetic) is a protocol-driven cognitive engine designed to process wicked problems: problems that are ill-defined, paradoxical, non-decomposable, and resistant to single optimal solutions.

Unlike classical prompt-response paradigms, UNO-S enforces a structured cognitive trace composed of sequential cycles (C1 → C2 → C3 → D1) with an optional escalation module (UNO-F).
The primary output of the system is not an answer, but a reproducible epistemic process: a logged sequence of conflicts, corrections, reframings, and deployment translations.

Version 1.3 (“Epistemic Glitch”) introduces hardened contradiction detection, guided correction vectors, recursive failure memory (ghost_log), and a dedicated deployment phase.

1. Motivation: Why Prompting Fails on Wicked Problems

Most contemporary AI interactions follow a shallow loop:

prompt → response → subjective evaluation

This approach fails systematically when:

the problem contains mutually exclusive truths,

the framing itself is part of the problem,

the observer’s assumptions distort the solution space,

optimization collapses meaning instead of clarifying it.

In such cases, better answers are not the goal.
Better questions, better frames, and visible reasoning failures are.

UNO-S was designed to force friction, expose hidden assumptions, and preserve cognitive failures as first-class data.

2. Core Design Principles

UNO-S is built on five non-negotiable principles:

2.1 Process over Outcome

The epistemic value lies in how a conclusion is reached, not what it is.

2.2 Contradiction as Signal

A valid run must surface a Vital Contradiction — a binary, mutually exclusive tension that cannot be resolved by simple aggregation.

2.3 Guided Correction

Rejection without directional correction is epistemically useless.
Every rejected hypothesis must produce a correction_vector.

2.4 Memory of Failure

Recursive attempts inherit a ghost_log — a structured memory of why previous runs failed.

2.5 Human-Readable Deployment

Abstract insight is incomplete until translated into operational language.

3. System Architecture Overview

UNO-S operates as a tricyclic cognitive engine with an optional escalation layer.

Problem
  ↓
C1 — Perception (Conflict Detection)
  ↓
C2 — Autoreflection (Assumption Deconstruction)
  ↓
C3 — Recontextualization (Frame Reconstruction)
  ↓
D1 — Deployment (Human Interface)
  ↘
 UNO-F — Higher-Order Escalation (if stuck)

Each cycle is executed through three roles:

Uczeń (Learner) — generative exploration

Nauczyciel (Teacher) — constraint, validation, correction

Obserwator (Observer) — synthesis and commit creation

4. Cycle Definitions
4.1 C1 — Perception: Vital Contradiction Detection

Goal:
Identify a real, painful contradiction embedded in the problem.

Key Outputs:

chaos_bundle — conflicting narratives and signals

vital_contradiction — binary, mutually exclusive tension

commit_1 — formalized problem tension

friction_score — difficulty of finding the contradiction

Transition Rule:
C1 succeeds only if:

contradiction is binary and exclusive

friction_score > 0.6

Otherwise, the system loops back with enforced search pressure.

4.2 C2 — Autoreflection: Assumption Deconstruction

Goal:
Expose hidden assumptions and redirect exploration away from guesswork.

Key Outputs:

hypotheses

refactored_models

correction_vector

commit_2 — map of blind spots and invalid assumptions

Critical Constraint:
If the Teacher rejects a hypothesis, a correction_vector is mandatory.
Rejection without direction is treated as failure.

4.3 C3 — Recontextualization: Frame Reconstruction

Goal:
Determine whether the entire game is misframed and construct a new ontology.

Key Outputs:

frame_question

new_frame

commit_3 — stable cognitive attractor

Recursion Rule:
If successive commit_3 outputs converge (>0.9 similarity), the system recurses with inherited ghost_log.

4.4 D1 — Deployment: Human-Readable Interface

Goal:
Translate abstract insight into operational language.

Outputs:

metaphor — conceptual compression

strategy_one_liner — executive-level directive

eli5 — simplified explanation

This phase explicitly prioritizes usability over theoretical elegance.

5. UNO-F: Higher-Order Escalation Module

UNO-F activates when:

the system is stuck,

paradox is structurally irreducible,

identity convergence collapses.

UNO-F forces a question-of-the-question sequence:

F1: What causes this contradiction?

F2: How does my perspective generate it?

F3: Why is this question possible at all?

F4: Who is asking? (identity check)

Output:
A new higher-order problem + inherited ghost_log.

6. Metrics and Safeguards

UNO-S v1.3 introduces explicit evaluative metrics:

friction_score — cognitive resistance

chaos_tolerance — ability to hold conflicting data

paradox_resilience — constructive vs destructive paradox

identity_convergence — stability of epistemic identity

A recursion_guard halts execution if identity collapses beyond recovery, signaling the need for human meta-intervention.

7. What UNO-S Is Not

To avoid category errors, UNO-S is not:

a benchmark,

a ranking system for models,

an optimization engine,

a truth oracle.

UNO-S is a cognitive oscilloscope: it measures tension, not correctness.

8. Use Cases

Comparative analysis of AI reasoning styles

Exploration of socio-technical paradoxes

Strategy reframing under uncertainty

Human-AI co-thinking experiments

Documentation of epistemic failure modes

9. Conclusion

UNO-S v1.3 “Epistemic Glitch” formalizes something usually hidden:
the productive failure of thought.

By enforcing structure, memory, and translation, the engine transforms confusion into navigable terrain.
Not by resolving paradoxes — but by making them legible.
